# Selenium

WebDriverManager: Automatically manages the WebDriver binaries for you (no need to manually download the driver executable).
ChromeDriver: Controls the Chrome browser.
driver.get("https://www.google.com"): Opens Google's homepage.
searchBox.sendKeys(): Sends the search query "Selenium WebDriver" to the input field.
searchBox.submit(): Submits the search form (similar to pressing Enter).
Thread.sleep(2000): Pauses execution for 2 seconds to wait for the results to load. In a real-world scenario, you'd replace this with an explicit wait (WebDriverWait).
driver.getTitle(): Gets and prints the title of the current page.
driver.quit(): Closes the browser.

# Run the Code
To run the code, compile and execute the Java file. You should see Chrome open, perform the Google search, and print the page title in your console
